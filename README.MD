# Old Feather Cape

Why did they have to take away the jump height boost from the Valheim Feather Cape ? \
It's back now with this Valheim mod. \
This mod allows you to craft a modified version of the "Feather Cape" called "Old Feather Cape" which has the +20% jump height that got taken away with the Bog Witch update. Use the Galdr table to craft it.
